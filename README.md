# Whatsapp-Intergrated-Website
This project is a WhatsApp-integrated website designed to showcase products and engage customers through direct, real-time communication. The website features embedded promotional videos and a product catalog displaying items available for sale. Instead of a traditional checkout system, users can enquire about or purchase products by being redirected directly to WhatsApp, enabling fast and personalized interaction with the business.

The platform simplifies the buying process, improves customer engagement, and is ideal for small to medium businesses that rely on WhatsApp as their primary communication and sales channel.
